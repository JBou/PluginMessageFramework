PluginMessageFramework
============

Project is still a WIP, the framework can drastically change at any moment, use at your own risk.

PluginMessageFramework is a project evolved from the legacy project [PluginMessageAPI+](https://github.com/iKeirNez/PluginMessageAPI-Plus-LEGACY) and is licensed under the [MIT License](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).
It aims to provide a seamless plugin message api across multiple implementations allowing plugin messages to be handled as packet objects rather than simple primitive types.
